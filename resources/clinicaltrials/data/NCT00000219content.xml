  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical and immunological effects of the
      phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor, CC-10004, on skin inflammation associated with cutaneous
      lupus erythematosus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Discoid cutaneous lupus is the most common cutaneous manifestation of lupus erythematosus, a
      chronic, immune mediated disease of unknown etiology.  The immune processes underlying
      cutaneous lupus remain largely unexplored, but recent evidence suggests a role for dendritic
      cells (DCs), type 1 interferons (IFN) and Th1-type immune processes.  Treatment of cutaneous
      lupus remains limited primarily to anti-malarials, with thalidomide an effective secondary
      agent.  However, side effects associated with these treatments are potentially problematic
      with chronic use.  Phosphodiesterases (PDE) are critical enzymes that degrade cAMP.  In
      particular, PDE type 4 (PDE4) activity is found in inflammatory and immune cells, including
      DCs. The immune modulator CC-10004 is a PDE4 inhibitor with demonstrated low toxicity in
      phase I and II clinical studies with potential efficacy in cutaneous lupus. CC-10004 is a
      well-tolerated, selective PDE4 inhibitor with demonstrated inhibitory effects on Th1-type
      cytokines and other inflammatory mediators and is under development for the treatment of
      inflammatory and immune mediated conditions.  Prior studies include pilot trials in
      psoriasis and exercise-induced asthma, with results suggesting clinical efficacy in the
      former study. This open label, pilot study of 16 weeks duration will explore the clinical
      and immune-modulating effects of CC-10004 in 10 cutaneous discoid lupus patients.  Patients
      meeting study criteria will receive the drug for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week washout
      period.  Study visit time points will include weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16, during
      which we will measure outcomes for clinical, immunological and safety parameters.  To
      investigate early immunological changes occurring in response to treatment, we will also
      perform skin punch biopsies of lesional sites at week 0 and week 4 for immunohistochemical
      and molecular analysis.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When one receives a local anesthetic, such as novocaine for a dental procedure, there is a
      burning painful sensation experienced upon injection of the local anesthetic. We are trying
      to understand the role of pH (how acidic a solution is) in the production of pain during
      local anesthetic administration. We hypothesize that less acidic solutions produce less
      burning. We also want to determine whether or not the pH of the solution affects the rate of
      onset of the local anesthesia. We will recruit subjects from patients who have a clinical
      indication for lumbar medial branch (LMB) nerve blocks, procedures frequently performed at
      the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Pain Medicine. For each patient, three nerve
      blocks are administered at adjacent spinal levels, typically using either lidocaine or
      bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine as the local anesthetic. We will add a saline control as part
      of the research procedure and then provide lidocaine at the control location before
      continuing with the nerve blocks. This clinical procedure offers an ideal opportunity to
      compare the effects of the three solutions. There will be almost no deviation from the
      standard clinical procedure. After the injection of each solution, the pain score on
      administration of the medication will be recorded immediately. We will also provide a
      continuous stimulation (pin taps) after the local anesthetic injection and record when the
      patient experiences hypoesthesia (reduced sensation) and anesthesia (absent sensation).
      Finally, we will record the pain score upon reinsertion of a needle to mark the precise
      location (part of the clinical procedure) one minute after the local anesthetic injection.
      All data will be collected during the a single clinical visit.

      The study will conclude when 60 subjects have successfully been tested. Data will be
      reviewed annually.
